Provides an interface for developers to easily add PHP code to posts and widgets via selectable shortcodes.

== Description ==

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03yDdrhOSN4

This plugin allows developers to easily add PHP code to their posts and widgets.  All *.snippet.php* files contained in the configured directory will be executable via a corresponding [shortcode].  For example, a file named *my-code.snippet.php* can be executed by adding a [my-code] shortcode to your post content.  The source directory is configurable: you can put it anywhere on your server that you wish, e.g. you can enhance the security of your code by storing it _outside_ your server's document root.  

By keeping all the PHP code in PHP files, you ensure that your WordPress posts and pages remain clean.  All available shortcodes are listed when the user clicks a custom TinyMCE button.

See the [Project Home Page](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-php-snippets/) for more information.  This plugin requires PHP 5.2.6 or greater.

This plugin can save you from writing lots of other plugins because you can easily tie into PHP files without having to register your own plugins.

WARNING: this has not been tested on Windows servers.  Sorry, but I don't have access to one, so I've been unable to tune the permissions checks.

== Installation ==

You can install this plugin in the standard way from the WordPress plugin admin screen, or you can download its files and upload the `php-snippets` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.  

1. Upload the `php-snippets` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Create a new post or page
1. Notice the new `<?php` button in the TinyMCE toolbar -- click it to get a list of available PHP Snippets, then select the one you want to insert it into your post.
1. Optionally, configure your custom snippet directory under the Settings --> PHP Snippets directory and put in the /full/path/to/your/directory

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My Snippets are not showing up!=

Make sure your files use the `.snippet.php` extension and that you have correctly configured your PHP Snippets directory under *Settings --> PHP Snippets*.  The directory has to be a *full* path, e.g. `/home/myuser/public_html/snippets`  

Only `*.snippet.php` files inside your PHP Snippet directory _OR_ inside of an immediate subfolder will be selectable.  Deeper hierarchies are not supported.

The reason that only `*.snippet.php` files are listed is because some scripts may involve multiple PHP files: by giving only one file the `*.snippet.php` extension, you can control which file is the "main" file.

= What information needs to be in the Snippet header? =

Your Snippets should include an information header in the same way that WordPress plugins and themes, but it's much simplified.  Include a *Description:* and a *Shortcode:* to indicate a description and a sample shortcode, respectively.

`
/*
Description: Generates a link to a post or page based on its ID.
Shortcode: [link id=123]Click here[/link]
*/`

Look at the examples in the `php-snippets/snippets` directory for some examples.

= What inputs does my Snippet get? =

Anything you pass in your shortcode will be passed to your Snippet. E.g. `[mySnippet x="123" y="Llama"]` will make the variables `$x` and `$y` available in your Snippet (they would contain "123" and "Llama", respectively). The `$content` variable is reserved for when you use a _full_ tag, e.g. `[mySnippet]My content goes here[/mySnippet] would make `$content` contain the text "My content goes here".

= What should my Snippet output? =

Your Snippet should _print_ its output (not _return_ it).  This makes it easy for you to include reusable bits of HTML.

Technically speaking, your code doesn't _have_ to output anything -- some scripts may only need to execute on the back-end and remain out of site.


= There's a Bug in the Plugin! =

Check to make sure the bug is actually in the plugin and not in one of your Snippets.  This plugin acts mostly as a pass-through, and the error messages should be confined to your code (hopefully not mine).  If there's something goofy going on, please let me know by filing a [bug report](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-php-snippets/issues/list).
